DataZoom Social Stata `datazoom_social` is a package that enables compatibility with microdata from surveys conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). With this package, it is possible to read all household surveys conducted by IBGE: Demographic Census, National Household Sample Survey (PNAD), Monthly Employment Survey (PME), Household Expenditure Survey (POF), and Urban Informal Economy Survey (ECINF).

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Enter the code below in Stata's command line to download and install the DataZoom Social package's files:

```
net install datazoom_social, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datazoompuc/datazoom_social_stata/master/") force
```

## Syntax <a name="syntax"></a>

The package's syntax can be summarized as follows:

__datazoom_social__ [, *options*]

Where the [*options*] can be:

| Options            | Description                                                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `survey(...)`   | Survey selection                                                      |
| `source(...)`    | Folder where the raw data is saved                                    |

___Attention:___ For POF 2017-2018, Standardized Bases and Selected Expenditures are not available.

## Auxiliary Programs (Dictionaries) <a name="aux"></a>

Most of the package programs encounter original data stored in *.txt* format, which requires dictionaries – *.dct* format in Stata – to be read. The result is a volume of dictionaries that exceeds the 100-file limit allowed for a Stata package to be installed. Therefore, individual dictionaries are compressed into a single *.dta* file, read within each program. Both functions are defined in the file *read_compdct.ado*.

The first program defined in this file is `write_compdct`, which can be used as follows: after running the *.ado* file to define the function, simply use the code:

    write_compdct, folder("/folder with dictionaries") saving("/path/dict.dta")

The function then reads all *.dct* files present in the folder and combines them into the *dict.dta* file, with each dictionary identified by a variable with its name.

To transform this compressed file back into the original dictionary, we reccomend using the `read_compdct` program:

    read_compdct, compdct("dict.dta") dict_name("original_dict") out("extracted_dict.dct")

which extracts the *original_dict* from the *dict.dta* file and saves it as *extracted_dict.dct*. 
As an example, see the use of this function in the `datazoom_pnadcontinua` program:

    tempfile dic // Temporary file where the extracted .dct will be saved

    findfile dict.dta // Finds the dict.dta file saved by the package installation
                      // in the /ado/ folder and stores the path to it in the r(fn) 
                      //macro.

    read_compdct, compdct("`r(fn)'") dict_name("pnadcontinua`lang'") out("`dic'")
      // Reads the compacted dict.dta dictionary, extracts the pnadcontinua 
      // dictionary (or pnadcontinua_en, `lang` is empty or "_en"), and saves the 
      // final file in the tempfile dic, which is used to read the data.

For our internal organization, each folder corresponding to a program stores the dictionaries in the */dct/* sub-folder. All these dictionaries are also stored together in the */dct/* folder directly, which is used to generate the *dict.dta* file using `write_compdct`. Note that no *.dct* files are actually listed in the *datazoom\_social.pkg* file, and therefore, they are not installed on the user's computer. Only the *dict.dta* file is sent.

## Program Structure <a name="structure"></a>

The functions of the package generally follow the structure below:

```stata
program datazoom_example
syntax, original(string) ... // Main function to be executed by the dialog boxes or datazoom_social

...

load_example, options // Data reading program defined below

...

(Data loading)

treat_example // Any data treatment

...  

save  

end

program load_example

...

end

program treat_example

...

end
```

**Data Loading:** As an example, let's look at a section of the PNS program:

```stata
program load_pns
syntax, original(str) year(integer) [english]

if "`english'" != "" local lang "_en"

tempfile dic (*)

findfile dict.dta (*)

read_compdct, compdct("`r(fn)'") dict_name("pns`year'`lang'") out("`dic'") (*)

qui infile using `dic', using(PNS_`year'.txt) clear

end
```

The lines marked with (\*) just extract the required dictionary to read the data, as explained in the previous section. Observing the program options, `load_pns` receives the folder that stores the raw data, the chosen year, and the option for English labels, which causes the pns20xx\_en dictionary to be read instead of pns20xx.

The first line inside this function is found in most programs in the package: when the user chooses the *english* option, a local variable with the same name is saved, storing the string "english". Since all English dictionaries are stored with the \_en suffix, this line says that if this *english* macro is not empty – which only happens when the user chooses this option – the local variable *lang* is created with the string "\_en," which serves as a suffix for the name of the dictionary to be read.

The heart of this *load* function is in the *infile* line, which uses the extracted dictionary to read the raw data file and load it into Stata memory.
