The PNAD-Covid aims to monitor the estimated number of individuals with symptoms associated with flu-like illness, typical of Covid-19, and its impacts on the Brazilian labor market.

PNAD-Covid survey comprises interviews performed monthly. The survey contemplates questions about the occurrence of the major symptoms of COVID-19 in all residents of the household. For those who have any symptoms, the survey asks what they did to relieve the symptoms; if they sought medical care; and the type of health facility sought. Additionally, questions are questions about labor and income.
