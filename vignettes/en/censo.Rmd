The Census (Censo Demográfico) is conducted every ten years by IBGE. All households in the country are visited by IBGE agents. This survey counts the population and collects basic information about residents, such as age and gender.

IBGE also conducts a more detailed interview on a large random sample of households, investigating household members’ socio-demographic characteristics (schooling, income etc.), household’s characteristics (wall materials, plumbing etc.), and possession of physical assets (refrigerator, car etc.). In the 2010 Census sample, there are 6.2 million households and 20.6 million individuals.

### Microdata

For each year, there is a data file for each unit of the federation (state). Until 1991, there was only one file for both household and individual characteristics. Since 2000, there is one file for each type of record.

Our Census program applies to the 1970, 1980, 1991, 2000 and 2010 rounds of the Census. The 2000 and 2010 microdata and documentation are available for download from the IBGE website on [this link](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/populacao/22827-censo-2020-censo4.html?=&t=microdados). For information on how to acquire other rounds, [click here](https://loja.ibge.gov.br/catalogsearch/result/?q=censo).

Because of methodological changes made by IBGE over the years, the same information may not be available every year and/or may not have been collected in the same way. Data Zoom offers an option to manipulate the variables subject to compatibility in order to standardize information over time. In this case, variable names are not the ones suggested by the original dictionary and a new dictionary is provided for download. The document titled [Making Censuses Compatible](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datazoompuc/datazoom_social_stata/master/docs/Censo/compatibilizacao_en.pdf) explains all the procedures adopted in the process.

In the 2010 Census, microdata for 14 municipalities were corrected, thus two new files were released for the observations reviewed. It is necessary to download, in addition to the file containing the microdata, the following file "microdados_14_municipios_com_areas_redefinidas_20160331" available at [this link](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/sociais/saude/22827-censo-demografico-2022.html?=&t=microdados) and add it to the same folder where the microdata is located on your computer.
